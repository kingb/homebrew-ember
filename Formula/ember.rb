  # Intended for Linux (macOS installs the notarized app bundle via the cask
  # instead), but not hard-restricted: there's no real `depends_on` gate for
  # "Linux only" in Homebrew, and this builds fine cross-platform anyway.

  # Build-time headers for winit/wgpu's Wayland/X11/GL bindings. Deliberately
  # NOT depending on Homebrew's own mesa/vulkan-loader/libxkbcommon: the
  # built binary has zero link-time dependency on any of them (winit/wgpu
  # dlopen X11/Wayland/Vulkan/EGL at runtime, confirmed via ldd showing only
  # libc/libm/libgcc), so the system's real GPU driver stack is what actually
  # gets loaded regardless of what's on the build machine. See em-8se.10.1.
